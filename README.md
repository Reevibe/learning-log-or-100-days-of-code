# learning-log-or-100-days-of-code
### Day 1: Learned about Base Smart Contracts.
​Initialized Learning Log for Base Ecosystem. Today I officially started my journey into the Base ecosystem. I've set up this repository to track my progress and began researching the "Superchain" concept. Base is built on the OP Stack, which means it shares a lot of DNA with Optimism. My goal is to understand how L2s scale Ethereum while keeping fees low.
Day 2: Network Configuration 
Configure Base Sepolia RPC
​Log: Added the Base Sepolia Testnet to my wallet today. 
​Chain ID: 84532
​Currency: ETH
​Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org/
Also requested some testnet ETH from a faucet to prepare for contract deployments.
Day 3: Exploring BaseScan
