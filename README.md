# learning-log-or-100-days-of-code
### Day 1: Learned about Base Smart Contracts.
​Initialized Learning Log for Base Ecosystem. Today I officially started my journey into the Base ecosystem. I've set up this repository to track my progress and began researching the "Superchain" concept. Base is built on the OP Stack, which means it shares a lot of DNA with Optimism. My goal is to understand how L2s scale Ethereum while keeping fees low.
Day 2: Network Configuration 
Configure Base Sepolia RPC
​Log: Added the Base Sepolia Testnet to my wallet today. 
​Chain ID: 84532
​Currency: ETH
​Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org/
Also requested some testnet ETH from a faucet to prepare for contract deployments.
Day 3: Exploring BaseScan
Commit Message: docs: Day 3 - Learning to read L2 transactions
Log: Spent time on BaseScan today. It's interesting to see how "L1 Data Fees" and "L2 Execution Fees" are separated. Navigating the "Verified Contracts" section to see how other developers are structuring their code on Base.
Day 4: Foundry Installation
Commit Message: docs: Day 4 - Setup Foundry development environment
Log: Installed Foundry today. It’s a blazing-fast toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. Ran forge init to see the default project structure. I prefer this over Hardhat because I can write my tests in Solidity instead of JavaScript.
Day 5: The Bridging Process
Commit Message: docs: Day 5 - Researching L1 to L2 bridging
